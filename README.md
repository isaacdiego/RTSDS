# Real Time Simulator of Dynamic System (RTSDS)

Based on my graduate final assignment, I implemented a plataform for real time simulation of dynamic systems using the PSoC and Arduino platforms. The codes for each platform can be obtained in this repository and are separated by folders.
For a better explanation of the platform, please read this article: http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s141019176
